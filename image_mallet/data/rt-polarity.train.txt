1884 neg it's everything you don't go to the movies for .

11597 pos high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
2290 neg it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .

11231 pos manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time . 
308 neg the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
4872 neg slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
12138 pos you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch .

12196 pos muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic .

806 neg several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
5288 neg any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
2943 neg painfully padded . 
127 neg the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .

3476 neg despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
11555 pos it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .

13653 pos the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
1338 neg friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
11778 pos  . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
13035 pos i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies .

4120 neg neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
1816 neg scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas .

12656 pos there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
12065 pos birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns . 
3472 neg many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short .

11460 pos [a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
5072 neg feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
4727 neg the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
12297 pos a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry . 
13374 pos chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them .

4426 neg this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
13201 pos with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism .

4028 neg no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .

1256 neg i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
4681 neg a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
2660 neg a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
11097 pos ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
15271 pos the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon .

13303 pos it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . . 
5012 neg while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
2915 neg de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins .

1637 neg uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
13785 pos this is a very funny , heartwarming film . it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect . 
10090 pos doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
15287 pos brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
709 neg guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .

14303 pos broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
11020 pos shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
11274 pos dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 
14142 pos a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
1392 neg kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
10978 pos the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
10286 pos the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts .

219 neg although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
10655 pos goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast .

13451 pos  . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended ) , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor . 
14604 pos it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
907 neg with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike .

13173 pos if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
11665 pos the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
3407 neg you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .

14367 pos an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences… the château is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten .

3016 neg a mild , reluctant , thumbs down . 
4143 neg nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done .

2735 neg a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years .

14713 pos a cutesy romantic tale with a twist .

3722 neg the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
11519 pos the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back .

2579 neg reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
13567 pos as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it's not quite the genre-busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .

3553 neg priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .
